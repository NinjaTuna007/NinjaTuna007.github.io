## Introduction

üëã Welcome to my page. I am currently a PhD student at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en), specializing in Underwater Robotics. My research focuses on multi-agent systems, data fusion, and machine learning, with the objective of advancing underwater exploration technologies.

In addition to my academic pursuits, music holds a significant place in my life. üé∂ I have been a trained Hindustani classical singer for over 12 years. This musical journey has not only enriched my personal life but also provided a unique perspective and balance to my academic endeavors. Music, with its intricate patterns and emotional depth, has been a source of inspiration and creativity, influencing my approach to problem-solving and research.

üéæ I am also an avid tennis player, finding the sport to be an excellent way to stay active and engaged. Whether participating in a casual match or practicing, tennis offers a grounding and energizing experience.

‚úçÔ∏è Beyond academics and sports, I have a passion for writing. It allows me to articulate my thoughts clearly and communicate ideas effectively.

Thank you for visiting my page. Feel free to connect with me to discuss mutual interests and potential collaborations.

## Current Role

As part of the Underwater Robotics team at KTH, my work focuses on solving challenges in autonomous systems and underwater perception. I'm also a WASP Doctoral Fellow, supported by the [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)](https://wasp-sweden.org/), which fuels my passion for robotics and AI.

## Research Interests

My PhD is aligned with [SMaRC 2.0](https://www.smarc.se/) ‚Äì Swedish Maritime Robotics Centre's latest initiative. Through SMaRC 2.0, I aim to contribute to the next generation of autonomous underwater systems, working alongside industry leaders like [Saab](https://www.saab.com/) and [Ocean Infinity](https://oceaninfinity.com/). The combination of academic research and real-world applications excites me most about this field.

## Background

I hold a Master's degree in Machine Learning from [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en), where I developed a strong foundation in AI and robotics. My thesis focused on using multi-modal machine learning techniques for fault detection in telecom networks. Previously, I studied Mathematics at the [Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru](https://www.iisc.ac.in/), where I explored mathematical structures and their applications. This laid the groundwork for my future research in AI.

## Gratitude

Thanks to my supervisor, Professor [John Folkesson](https://www.kth.se/profile/johnf), and the entire [RPL division at KTH](https://www.kth.se/is/rpl/division-of-robotics-perception-and-learning-1.779439). Their guidance has been invaluable.

## What‚Äôs Next?

I'm looking forward to pushing the boundaries of AI in maritime robotics, collaborating with the brilliant minds in the [SMaRC community](https://www.smarc.se/), and tackling the unique challenges of exploring the ocean's depths.
